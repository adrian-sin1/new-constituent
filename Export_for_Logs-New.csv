At the moment, there nothing else that can be done.  Based on the last 4/23/2025 inspection, I doubt that NYC DOH will make another inspection this soon unless there's proof (this is the reason why we check the RATS Portal information first).


My suggestion is to please get NYC DSNY involved and force the owner to get that space cleaned first.

It makes so sense to me why they didn�t pave those remaining corners. Those buses parked. In there are school buses they could harm the children if rats get into the buses

Suzette submitted those two most recent tickets. She could give more detail on those. But 311-22255701 was definitely for 166 Kings Highway and for rats. It was an empty lot that was paved over and is being used temporarily to park school buses. That's where the rats are coming from.

Are the addresses on those 311# correct?  Was this complaint for RATS?



166 Kings Highway is an empty lot.  The complaint said this is for Lot Condition.



The last inspection in the area nearby was 4/23/2025 at 174 Kings Highway � 2 weeks ago.

Suzette submitted those two most recent tickets. She could give more detail on those. But 311-22255701 was definitely for 166 Kings Highway and for rats. It was an empty lot that was paved over and is being used temporarily to park school buses. That's where the rats are coming from.

Hi Dmytro,

Thank you for contacting our office about this matter. I checked the 311 number you mentioned (#311-22698454) and it is not showing up in the system. It might be missing one digit, please double-check it, or file a new complaint here: Click to Report Housing Used for Short-Term Rental<https://portal.311.nyc.gov/sr-step/?id=ca9fbed9-1f25-f011-9d48-7c1e529ce39b&stepid=749ab462-2a52-e811-a836-000d3a33b56b>. It would be great if you could attach the evidence and include as many details as possible in the 311 complaint. Once you have the updated SR number, I will reach out to the appropriate enforcement agencies.

Dear Councilmember Susan Zhuang,



I am a resident of 44 Bay 41st Street, 2nd FLOOR Brooklyn, NY 11214 and I am writing to report an illegal hostel or transient short-term rental operation on the first floor of our building.



The Certificate of Occupancy clearly designates the first floor for one-family use. However, the apartment has been divided into multiple rooms (each labeled Room 1, Room 2, Room 3, etc.), and there is a constant turnover of short-term renters carrying luggage in and out. I have collected evidence, including photographs of the room numbers inside the unit and records of frequent visitor activity.



This illegal operation has caused significant disturbances, including excessive noise (especially late at night), fire and safety concerns due to overcrowding, and a general decline in the quality of life for residents.



I have previously filed complaints with 311. [SR SUBMITTED #311-22698454 ] which was filed on 4/25/25 but the issue continues for approximately 2 years when I rented the apartment. But landlord told me only about one person who lives downstairs (1st floor). Now the situation is very serious because these people downstairs started to play clips with crazy noises on the repeat and very loud to provoke me and my family but my mom who lives with me and my 11 yo daughter cannot handle it anymore. They are very scared and my mom started to have health issues because of the constant stress� Our landlord CANNOT do anything about it maybe he allows this to happen , these people on the first floor didn�t even let the landlord inside when I asked him to come (I even have the video of this incident) and listen to the crazy sounds(I recorded it also) they were playing on purpose to put us on stress. I constantly Texting and Calling landlord to make something about it but most of the time he didn�t even respond (I have all the evidence about it )



I respectfully request that the Department of Buildings and the Office of Special Enforcement investigate this matter urgently and take all necessary enforcement actions to restore the legal and safe use of the premises.



Thank you for your attention to this serious issue.



Sincerely,

Dmytro Makogon

Subject: RE: Lien Sale 10 Day Notice List
?

Hello Council Members & Staff,



Attached is the updated 10-day list of properties at risk of having their tax liens sold on May 20. As usual, the list can be filtered by Council district using the filtering function in Excel.



At this point, almost 30 percent of the 29,000 properties originally at risk of having liens sold have resolved their status and have been removed from the list, bringing it down to about 18,000 properties.



In prior lien sales, the final 10 days generally sees the biggest number of resolutions with another 40 percent of the properties resolving their debt at this last stage, either through payments, payment plans, exemptions, or other actions. In other words, over half the activity of removing a property from the lien sale often occurs in the last 10 days. So your offices may expect to see more activity from constituents on this list in these final days.



As always, please do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions.



Thank you,

Emre

Subject: Lien Sale 90 Day Notice List

Hello Council Members & Staff,

This year�s Lien Sale will be held in May. To avoid being included in the lien sale, all property owners must take actions to resolve their delinquency by May 19. PLEASE ENCOURAGE YOUR CONSTITUENTS TO EITHER: 1) PAY AT LEAST THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OWED, 2) APPLY FOR AN EXEMPTION, OR 3) ENTER INTO A PAYMENT AGREEMENT TO PREVENT INCLUSION INTO THE LIEN SALE!

Attached is an excel sheet of the 90 day list for properties noticed for sale for the 2025 Lien Sale.  Notices have also been mailed to affected property owners. The notice will include charges owed, payment agreement information, and information on certain property tax exemptions (Senior Citizen Home Owner Exemption, Disable Homeowner Exemption, Circuit Breaker Exemption) and other programs like Easy Exit that can exclude a property owner from the lien sale. Keep in mind that the recent legislation created multiple ways for an owner to resolve their delinquency beyond just paying their debt, so an owner should explore all options before making a decision before the May 19 deadline. More information on the numerous resolution options is in the attached factsheet.


The attached list is sortable and contains the following information:

�         Borough, Block, Lot

�         Council District

�         Tax Class code

�         Building Class

�         Street Address and Zip Code

�         Amount Owed � both Total owed, and amount nee

�         Charge type

I will send additional lists at the 60 and 30 day marks prior to the May 19 last day to pay date.

More information about the lien sale, including already scheduled outreach sessions is located here: http://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-lien-sales.page

Additional information can be found in the email I sent on Tuesday, February 4.

Please reach out with any questions,
Thanks
Emre

Subject: Save the Date: January 30 - Property Tax Enforcement Briefing for Constituent Facing Staff


Hello Council Members & Staff,



On Thursday, January 30, from 3-4 pm, the Department of Finance, along with sister agencies, will provide Council Members and Staff a virtual briefing (link to come) of the upcoming 2025 Property Tax Enforcement efforts. This briefing will include information that your offices can share with constituents to know all the ways they can resolve their delinquency status and prevent their inclusion in this year�s lien sale.



What is the Lien Sale?

When property owners fail to pay property taxes, water bills, and other charges against their property, and the debts remain unpaid for long enough, these unpaid charges become tax liens that become subject to heightened enforcement action. If a property's delinquency status is not resolved in time, the liens on the property can be sold to a Trust that is created and controlled by the City. If the Trust is unable to resolve the debt with the owner, it can begin foreclosure proceedings.



How can a property or homeowner avoid the Lien Sale?

Local Law 82 of 2024 implemented the largest reforms to the City's tax lien sale process since it first was created nearly 30 years ago. These reforms included including creating numerous and overlapping ways for homeowners to resolve their delinquency status and avoid the lien sale. Many of these resolutions, including installment plans and tax deferrals, do not require any down payments. The briefing will review all the different ways to avoid the lien sale. The goal is to collect delinquent revenues from property owners who have the means to pay, while providing long-term solutions to at-risk homeowners who are struggling.



When's the Lien Sale?

This year�s lien sale will take place in May. The 90-day notification to property owners will be mailed on February 12 by the Department of Finance. Your offices will be provided the list of property owners who have received the notice.



Briefing Information



Date: Thursday, January 30, 2025

Dear Susan Zhuang,
     share with City Council Members
    NYC Council Member
    District 43 Brooklyn

        Today I spoke with a gentleman from the office of Assemblyman William Colton about a summons I received and was referred to your office since I reside in Council District 43. The summons was for not ""cleaning debris 18 inches from the curb"" apparently there is a code, sanitation provision,title 16 requiring residents to clean under this code during the ""established routing hour of 8am-8:59am"" and I believe 6pm-7pm, every day.

    I live on a residential block that always has a vehicle in front of the home that traps the trash around the tires and underneath, and also living downwind from a Commercial Street, ""Kings Highway"" which is always disgustingly filthy with steady stream of litter coming down the block.  I am 79 years old and constantly sweeping the front of my house and picking up litter, where possible.  Requiring homeowners to clean the curb mornings and evenings, seven days a week is impossible to abide by. This code 16 should be repealed.

    Mr. Colton's staffer was aware of this issue but passed the buck to you, Council Member Suzan Zhuang, saying the City Council has the authority to challenge this "" sanitation provision,title 16"" regulation. But I also think all NYS and NYC elected officials should be working together when there is a glaring injustice. After all NYC is in NYS.

    I was told that The Department of Sanitation can pass this regulation, without NYC Council approval, that penalize those the least responsible for the Cities litter and garbage problem. It's time to intervene on behalf of those not causing the problem and focus on the root causes. And this would be the job of the NYC Council and the NYS Assembly when a Department is out of step with its mission and is overly excessive with its regulatory authority.

hi Stanley,

Thank you and Anna for your help.

The landlord finally restored hot water (out since 3/22) and electricity (out since at 5:30ish am on 4/29/2025) around 8 pm tonight.   I think the former property  manager talked some sense into him.   Thank you for your help.  I have a feeling the battle is not over yet though.

thank you,

Thanks for following up, Stanley.  Many thanks to you and Anna for helping me today.

I called the tenant helpline and wrote emails.  It seems like I have connected with them already.   ahu@hpd.nyc.gov<mailto:ahu@hpd.nyc.gov> only covers rent control apartments.  The numbers I called referred me to other numbers but ultimately no real help came out of it.   I am worried about my safety so maybe I need to give up and just move at this point.

Regardless, thank you for your help!

Where can I get more help?

 � The Tenant Helpline is a free resource available to all New Yorkers, no matter your immigration status.
Tenant Helpline Specialists at the NYC Public Engagement Unit provide 1-on-1 support, in multiple
languages, to tenants experiencing harassment from their landlord. Call 311 and ask for the Tenant
Helpline. Learn more at nyc.gov/TenantHelpline<http://nyc.gov/TenantHelpline>.


I believe the 311# is up 24 hours.

To: <THPT@hpd.nyc.gov<mailto:THPT@hpd.nyc.gov>>

Dear THPT,

I hope this email finds you well.

I would like to file a complaint against my landlord who has been harassing me.

- The hot water has been turned off since 3/22/2025
- The electricity to my apartment has been turned off since 4/29/2025 around 5:30 am.
- He disconnected the radiators last year, although there are space heaters, they were not sufficient to heat the apartment due to the lack of insulation and often they would flip the breaker.  In those cases I would have to wait hours and sometimes days for them to flip the breaker back..
- There had been on-going construction without protection from dust and smell from getting into the apartment.
-He refused to replace the gas stove and we had a close call with gas poisoning.  He did remove the stove eventually with intervention from a 3rd party.
- He has made multiple buyout offers but calls them move-out incentives
- He dragged his feet on basic repairs as I have not had access to a functioning kitchen in months.
-He poured an unidentified red liquid into my apartment.  It evaporated within an hour, had a faint glue smell and made me sick.  I would often find a greasy substance on door handles/locks.  This scares me the most as I don't know what kind of poison I have come in contact with and what other substance I don't know about.   There is only a layer thin dry wall with the rest of the house with cracks though fixtures and pipes.  There are often strange smells coming from these areas as if poisonous gas is being piped through them .   I often get headaches and fevers.  I am the last one here, I am scared, and at my wits end.

I called the cops a number of times (a couple of times through transfer by 311)  but they were not happy, I would say even angry at me for involving them, and frankly do not view what he has done as crimes or assault.   A few of them flatly advised me to move.

I may need to move asap for my own safety but he should not be able to get away with this so freely.

Many thanks for your help,
Candice

Hi Stanley,



I�m reaching out on behalf of Inside Broadway. We would love to invite Councilmember Zhuang to a performance of our CASA show taking place at P.S. 186K (7601 19th Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11214) on Tuesday, May 20th at 5:15pm. The show will last approximately 45 minutes. I have attached a flyer about the show for more information.



If the Councilmember able to attend, we would love for her to speak to the audience of parents before the show or pass out certificates to the students afterwards. If she can only come for a portion of the show, we would be happy to adjust the schedule to accommodate her.



If she is able to come for the entire show, or just for the beginning, please arrive 5 to 10 minutes before to allow us time to prepare for your visit. Someone from our staff will be there as well; we will put you in touch with them closer to the performance date.



Please let us know if the Councilmember is able to attend. We would love to see her there!

Subject: FY26 Submission Process for Council Member Discretionary Capital Funding

Good Afternoon Budget Team,
Below is an overview of this year�s process for submitting Council Member Discretionary Capital funding, along with other key details.
Capital Funding Submission
Council Members have a total of $5 million in discretionary capital funding to allocate and must submit their proposed projects accordingly.   If Council Members want to fund Non-City projects, please be aware that Non-City projects are reviewed in CapGrants, and must receive approval from OMB, which can lead to either a partial approval or full denial of funding. This year�s submission template has been designed to account for such scenarios.
The attached ""FY26 Council Members Capital Template"" contains three worksheets:

  1.  Council Members � Use this to list the $5 million in discretionary capital allocations.
  2.  Ranked Backup Projects � If any Non-City projects are included in the Council Members worksheet, please list alternative projects that could replace them in case of partial or non-approval. If your submission contains only City projects, this worksheet does not need to be completed. Backup projects should be similar in value to the non-city projects included on the $5 million list.
  3.  Speaker Ranked Priorities � Enter up to eight projects in order of priority, including those from any delegation list or any other project the Member would like to indicate as a priority to the Speaker.  If you would like the Speaker to fund a portion of a project you are providing funding for on your $5 million list please only include the amount you want the Speaker to cover, not the entire amount you want to be funded in total.

Important Notes on Non-City Projects
If your submission includes Non-City projects, you must notify OMB through the CapGrants system to indicate your interest. Failing to check the appropriate box may result in OMB deprioritizing the project�s review, potentially delaying approval. Additionally, any issues raised by OMB must be addressed before a Non-City project can be included in the budget. The responsibility falls on the Member�s office to coordinate with the respective groups to resolve these issues, as OMB does not directly notify groups of project-related concerns. If you need assistance with reopening the portal for groups your Council Member wishes to fund, please reach out to me.

Submission Deadline
All Capital Funding Lists must be submitted by 5:00 PM on Monday, April 14th. If your office is participating in Participatory Budgeting, please submit your list by this deadline, using a placeholder of $1 million for those projects to be included from Participatory Budgeting. Once the voting results are available, you may update your submission with the winning projects. After receiving submissions, we will meet to address any eligibility concerns. (Meeting scheduling link will be sent separately)

Attachments for Reference

  1.  FY26 Council Members Capital Template � Please carefully review the template and use the same format for submission
  2.  NYC Schools List � Please make sure to include the Building and school codes for any school projects that you are submitting.  Schools located within leased spaced are sometimes not be eligible for technology funding. That determination is made later in the capital review process with most schools being deemed eligible for technology. Schools located within leased spaces are not eligible for construction funding.  Charter Schools operating within a DOE space are treated as city projects just like any other school projects.  Charter Schools operating within a space which they own must apply via CapGrants for capital funding. Charter Schools operating in spaces not owned by themselves or DOE are usually ineligible for any non-technology capital funding. Technology projects may be admissible via the general city process, please reach out to myself with specific examples.
  3.  Non-City Eligibility Guidelines � A resource for groups seeking meetings with your office, serving as a preliminary checklist to assess project eligibility.
  4.  CapGrants Portal Access � You can log in at Home Page - Dynamics 365<https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fombprod01.crm9.dynamics.com%2Fmain.aspx%3Fappid%3D743579ec-ef91-ed11-aad1-001dd804fbd7%26forceUCI%3D1%26pagetype%3Dcustom%26name%3Dcapgrant_app_d4b4e&data=05%7C01%7Clachanced%40omb.nyc.gov%7C10af057eba7f4d3d24e908db15001fe3%7C69fa79eee93a4ddfb8d1fbf15f49f820%7C0%7C0%7C638126862532785639%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=1nOd3t78EfSh5lmaNUkYqDYczbo9imYpbvWXh7QcMQw%3D&reserved=0> using your Council email and the same password as your email account.

Hi Stanley,

Just wanted to give you a follow up on this. I did call and spoke with Mr. Christopher Bae. When I asked him a few questions about the case, he said that Community Affairs unit might not be able to help. He stated that he will come to the precinct and speak with the Crime Analysis unit instead. He didn't want to speak with me further, which is fine. Just wanted to update you on this. I hope you have a great day and stay safe!

Dear Stanley,

 Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. Officer Haridi took the original police report. He classified the crime against Ms. Ling as an harassment. Ms. Ling was not able to properly communicate how she was more than just a victim of harassment. We need the record to reflect that she sustained bruises as a result of the incident. I showed the photos of the injuries to Officer Haridi in person and asked him to interview Ms. Ling�s thirteen year old son who was an eyewitness to the assault, but he has since not returned any of my calls or emails. We need your office�s help to get this resolved as soon as possible.

 The incident took place at 2123 W 7th St, where Ms. Ling is the property owner.

 Thank you,

 Christopher Bae, Esq.

Good Afternoon CM Zhuang�s office,
I am writing to inform you that both the Finance Division and the General Counsel�s office have completed their initial review of your FY26 Discretionary Funding Requests. You may now log back into the online system to review your original submissions and make any changes you see fit. When logging back in, you will find the awards located in the �FY2026 Council Member Designations� table on your dashboard. We have given each payment a unique Preliminary MOCS ID#, in addition to listing any issues or concerns we may have with the designation. Please see Finance and/or General Counsel Comment sections for awards that were not cleared/approved by either office.
In an effort to expedite the finalization of your list, we are asking that you please use the �CM Change Notes� section in the feedback area of the payment form to notate any fields you have changed. (Ex. CM Change Notes: POF & Amount�.OR�.Source, Program Name & POF)
** In the event your office needs to move awards between sources/pots, you must temporarily reduce the amount of the awards being moved in order to make funds available within those pots for the change. Also, please do not forget to update the �Fund� section to reflect the new source/pot.
[cid:image001.png@01DBBDDC.81E75D80]

Submission Deadline: We ask that you please submit your list for Round 2 review no later than 5p on Monday, May 19th, 2025.

Hi Stanley,

Thank you for the details and anytime. Discretionary has made a few minor adjustments to bring the CM�s Discretionary pot to a $0 balance. Discretionary will restrict CM�s Blackbaud access to make edits within existing allocations and will begin the review process. We will keep your office updated with any questions and/or concerns.

Please note that the CM office will be able to make adjustments to the FY26 allocations during the second round of the review process (around mid-April via Blackbaud), followed by a final round review (likely to be done via email) prior to the FY26 Adoption.

Good morning CM Zhuang�s office,

Hope you�re well.  Upon reviewing the preliminary database, Discretionary has identified several allocations that do not have an associated budget folder. As a result, the funding amount has been adjusted to $0.01 and moved to the ""CBO Defunded"" category. Please find the allocation details attached for your reference. Kindly confirm if these allocations are finalized for the review process.

Tabs Explained:
Removed allocations � allocations moved to �CBO Defunded� funding source
Totals � currently funding totals by funding source (fully designated)
FY26 Allocations 03.13.2025 � CM�s Expense Discretionary allocations

The mayor�s office gave me your contact hoping that you can help with a situation with a small landlord in our district.

The residents have come to our office complaining of harassment � and trying to kick out the residents.

Is there anything that the HPD can do to help force the landlord to turn the electricity back on (Con Ed) ?

Or force hot water to be turned back on?

Thanks for following up, Stanley.  Many thanks to you and Anna for helping me today.

I called the tenant helpline and wrote emails.  It seems like I have connected with them already.   ahu@hpd.nyc.gov<mailto:ahu@hpd.nyc.gov> only covers rent control apartments.  The numbers I called referred me to other numbers but ultimately no real help came out of it.   I am worried about my safety so maybe I need to give up and just move at this point.

Regardless, thank you for your help!

Where can I get more help?

 � The Tenant Helpline is a free resource available to all New Yorkers, no matter your immigration status.
Tenant Helpline Specialists at the NYC Public Engagement Unit provide 1-on-1 support, in multiple
languages, to tenants experiencing harassment from their landlord. Call 311 and ask for the Tenant
Helpline. Learn more at nyc.gov/TenantHelpline<http://nyc.gov/TenantHelpline>.


I believe the 311# is up 24 hours.

To: <THPT@hpd.nyc.gov<mailto:THPT@hpd.nyc.gov>>

Dear THPT,

I hope this email finds you well.

I would like to file a complaint against my landlord who has been harassing me.

- The hot water has been turned off since 3/22/2025
- The electricity to my apartment has been turned off since 4/29/2025 around 5:30 am.
- He disconnected the radiators last year, although there are space heaters, they were not sufficient to heat the apartment due to the lack of insulation and often they would flip the breaker.  In those cases I would have to wait hours and sometimes days for them to flip the breaker back..
- There had been on-going construction without protection from dust and smell from getting into the apartment.
-He refused to replace the gas stove and we had a close call with gas poisoning.  He did remove the stove eventually with intervention from a 3rd party.
- He has made multiple buyout offers but calls them move-out incentives
- He dragged his feet on basic repairs as I have not had access to a functioning kitchen in months.
-He poured an unidentified red liquid into my apartment.  It evaporated within an hour, had a faint glue smell and made me sick.  I would often find a greasy substance on door handles/locks.  This scares me the most as I don't know what kind of poison I have come in contact with and what other substance I don't know about.   There is only a layer thin dry wall with the rest of the house with cracks though fixtures and pipes.  There are often strange smells coming from these areas as if poisonous gas is being piped through them .   I often get headaches and fevers.  I am the last one here, I am scared, and at my wits end.

I called the cops a number of times (a couple of times through transfer by 311)  but they were not happy, I would say even angry at me for involving them, and frankly do not view what he has done as crimes or assault.   A few of them flatly advised me to move.

I may need to move asap for my own safety but he should not be able to get away with this so freely.

Many thanks for your help,
Candice

�I am following up on these budget requests form TAOTS - are there next steps?�

There�s no next step for schools right now..  The state budget was just handed down from Albany last week, and every Council District is involved with looking at their numbers right now.  We will have nothing to report until June 30, 2025.

�..��we invited Councilmember Zhuang to come to TAOTs in May�

My apologies, can you please resubmit that request?  I just did a search and nothing came up for TAOTS (unless it�s the same date/time as the BSI request).

I hope it has been a good spring. I am following up on these budget requests form TAOTS - are there next steps? Additionally we invited Councilmember Zhuang to come to TAOTs in May. Is that a possibility, and how can I finalize the schedule?

Dear Susan and Stanley,

I am the PTO President of PS 682- The Academy of Talented Scholars (TAOTS). I am writing on behalf of our parent community to express our thanks for your continued support to our school. Thank you for hosting the parent leader breakfast on January 17- I wish I could have been there in person, but our Title 1 PAC Chairperson Kelly Clancy was able to attend. I really appreciate how you have made yourselves available to hear from parents and engage thoughtfully with issues facing the schools in your district.

I wanted to follow up and share the TAOTS wish list for your consideration. There is overlap with the capital needs of BSI, with whom we share a building. We are so grateful for your continued support to our school community.

Building Needs:

1) HVAC system - our building heating and cooling system is extremely uneven and unreliable and in need of an upgrade. It results in students and staff tolerating significant discomfort in both hot and cold weather.

2) We would like to add 2 more refillable water stations in the building.

3) We would like to upgrade our outdoor playground area. Our courtyard has a hard surface and we worry about the safety of our students when they play outside. We also think there are ways to improve the design of our courtyard so that it improves the organization and enjoyment of the community space by all the schools in our building. We understand that funds may be available from your office to support the upgrade of our courtyard. Principal Sportella is included in this email and she is ready to take the next steps to claim the funds and move the project forward.

Support for Enrichment at TAOTS:

The TAOTS parent community is interested in using the discretionary funds that may be available to our school to pursue a swimming partnership with the JCH in our neighborhood, or to expand our after school chess program which is very popular with our students but has limited staff available to teach.
Thank you for your consideration and support
Lizzie Elston
TAOTS PTO President

I believe the 311# is up 24 hours.

To: <THPT@hpd.nyc.gov<mailto:THPT@hpd.nyc.gov>>

Dear THPT,

I hope this email finds you well.

I would like to file a complaint against my landlord who has been harassing me.

- The hot water has been turned off since 3/22/2025
- The electricity to my apartment has been turned off since 4/29/2025 around 5:30 am.
- He disconnected the radiators last year, although there are space heaters, they were not sufficient to heat the apartment due to the lack of insulation and often they would flip the breaker.  In those cases I would have to wait hours and sometimes days for them to flip the breaker back..
- There had been on-going construction without protection from dust and smell from getting into the apartment.
-He refused to replace the gas stove and we had a close call with gas poisoning.  He did remove the stove eventually with intervention from a 3rd party.
- He has made multiple buyout offers but calls them move-out incentives
- He dragged his feet on basic repairs as I have not had access to a functioning kitchen in months.
-He poured an unidentified red liquid into my apartment.  It evaporated within an hour, had a faint glue smell and made me sick.  I would often find a greasy substance on door handles/locks.  This scares me the most as I don't know what kind of poison I have come in contact with and what other substance I don't know about.   There is only a layer thin dry wall with the rest of the house with cracks though fixtures and pipes.  There are often strange smells coming from these areas as if poisonous gas is being piped through them .   I often get headaches and fevers.  I am the last one here, I am scared, and at my wits end.

I called the cops a number of times (a couple of times through transfer by 311)  but they were not happy, I would say even angry at me for involving them, and frankly do not view what he has done as crimes or assault.   A few of them flatly advised me to move.

I may need to move asap for my own safety but he should not be able to get away with this so freely.

Many thanks for your help,
Candice

Tenants on the block called last week when the hydrant stopped leaking.

Essentially, When the hydrant(s) leak on that block (or even 1 or 2 blocks away), there�s a drop in water pressure, and either not enough water is reaching the household, or black water is coming out.

Is there a 311# complaint for this, or who to reach out to research this water pressure issue (if it is an issue).

This is the 3rd time in 2 months we have received calls from that area � apparently, the residents in that area know to look for leaking hydrants when there�s a drop in water pressure.

Dear Council Member Zhuang,



My name is Peter Lambrakis, and I am the new owner of a 20-unit multifamily property in Dyker Heights address: 929 71st Street Brooklyn, NY 11228.



I am seeking your assistance regarding the denial of a street opening permit by NYC DOT for a critical gas service upgrade approved by National Grid.



The work is essential to replace outdated plumbing, gas, heat, and hot water systems, addressing existing violations and improving tenant quality of life. National Grid�s load letter request was submitted prior to learning about the street�s protected status following recent paving. The denial of this permit is causing delays that create undue hardship for both me and my tenants. My understanding is that the street cannot be interrupted for 5 years but I was unaware of the planned street paving work prior to purchasing the property or starting the essential work.

I have attached the permit application, load letter request, and the DOT denial notice for your reference. I kindly request your support in communicating with DOT to explore possible solutions so this urgent work can proceed.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Peter Lambrakis

Leroy:
I have a building owner with a special problem�  The owner wants to (need to) put in a new boiler to his building.
The building have had several violations due to low pressures  (dating back to 2005)
https://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/ActionsByLocationServlet?requestid=1&allbin=3146863&allinquirytype=BXS4OCV3&stypeocv3=V
The new owner has put in for a new and larger gas line in preparation for the new boiler to be bought in � however, National Grid had the permit turned down because of new re-paving of the street (see below).
Can anything be done to help this guy?

Hi Stanley,

Thank you for the quick reply. Yes that is the property.

The DOT put the street on protected list on 10/23/2024 and only publishes the upcoming street pavings 1 week in advance (10/15/2024).

Best,

Peter

Dear Council Member Zhuang,



My name is Peter Lambrakis, and I am the new owner of a 20-unit multifamily property in Dyker Heights address: 929 71st Street Brooklyn, NY 11228.



I am seeking your assistance regarding the denial of a street opening permit by NYC DOT for a critical gas service upgrade approved by National Grid.



The work is essential to replace outdated plumbing, gas, heat, and hot water systems, addressing existing violations and improving tenant quality of life. National Grid�s load letter request was submitted prior to learning about the street�s protected status following recent paving. The denial of this permit is causing delays that create undue hardship for both me and my tenants. My understanding is that the street cannot be interrupted for 5 years but I was unaware of the planned street paving work prior to purchasing the property or starting the essential work.

I have attached the permit application, load letter request, and the DOT denial notice for your reference. I kindly request your support in communicating with DOT to explore possible solutions so this urgent work can proceed.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Peter Lambrakis
9902 Fort Hamilton Parkway

Brooklyn, NY 11209

Attachments:

  *   DOB Boiler replacement permit approved on September 24th 2024
  *   Load Letter Request accepted by National Grid on October 4th 2024

Dear Council Member Zhuang,
My name is James Pool, and I have been a resident of New York City for over 20 years. My daughter, Billie, attends third grade in the New York City public school system, along with her little brother, Freddy, who is in kindergarten.
Billie is a precocious and caring girl.  For her year-end school project she has chosen to start a petition to ban Styrofoam and plastic egg cartons in New York City.  Billie believes that this will help reduce a common source of waste at little cost to New Yorkers � cardboard egg cartons are inexpensive and work great.  Billie hopes that banning Styrofoam and plastic egg cartons will encourage people to think about the impact of single-use plastic and to make more sustainable decisions when possible.
Billie has started a petition to garner support for a ban on environmentally harmful egg cartons, and I am reaching out in the hope that you will support Billie�s efforts to reduce harmful waste in New York City by amplifying her message and sharing her petition through whatever means you can.

Billie would also welcome the chance to speak with you to learn more about her cause and about advocacy more broadly.  We know that your time is valuable, but it would mean the world to her to get the opportunity to understand how ordinary citizens can improve our city and the world.
Thank you,
Billie Pool, age 8

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Meeting Request Re: P.S. 176 (Brooklyn, NY): Dangerous Conditions re Asbestos Due to School Construction Work (SZ)

Dear Ms. Susan Zhuang, NYC (Councilmember for District 43rd),

As you may know, my name is Andres Juarez and I'm a parent of children attending P.S. 176 The Ovington School located at 1225 Bay Ridge Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11219.

A delegation of P.S. 176 parent representatives and I would like to meet with you and your team, in-person, to further explain our continued concerns in connection with the above-referenced matter.  Please let us know your earliest availability so that we can talk and you can better understand our concerns.  Among other things, attached is a flyer with questions that we are seeking answers to from the P.S. 176 principal Elizabeth Culkin.

In connection with the NYC School Construction Authority's school construction work at P.S. 176, I have written several emails, and letters dated March 10, 2025, March 21, 2025 and most recently a letter dated April 16, 2025.  I have requested various documents, including the documents related to the P.S. 176's AHERA management plan.  My letter of April 16, 2025 is attached for ease of reference (see pages 6 and 7 regarding the requested documents).

As of today, I have not received any meaningful response from anyone.  No one has provided the documents that we have been requesting since the beginning.  The P.S. 176 principal Elizabeth Culkin continues to not be transparent and has not yet provided any of the documents requested regarding, among other things, the friable asbestos disturbance and exposure at our P.S. 176 school. Therefore, we don't have any actual data/information regarding the asbestos disturbance and exposure that our children, teachers and other school staff were already subjected to and allowed to endure.

I understand that the NYC SCA school construction work at P.S. 176 is now underway and that they have provided a new date of completion of August 2025.  However, that does not alleviate the seriousness of the friable disturbance and exposure of asbestos that the P.S. 176 children, teachers and other school staff were already subjected to and allowed to endure.

We want to prevent for our P.S. 176 school (or any other school) to be in a similar or same situation, now or in the future.  Therefore, for the health and safety of everyone, an investigation must be conducted and hold, the DOE/NYC Public Schools, DSF, NYC SCA, P.S. 176 and its principal Ms. Elizabeth Culkin, accountable for the many failures, including but not limited to:  (1) the failure to act in the best interest of the children, (2) the failure to take action that allowed the worsening conditions of the disturbed (friable) asbestos, (3) the failure to protect the children, teachers and other school staff, (4) the failure to comply with the law (e.g. AHERA), (5) the failure to inform and provide notification to parents, teachers and other school staff of the disturbance and exposure of friable asbestos, (6) the failure to provide all of the documents requested; and (7) the attempts to stop me from sharing the information related to the NYC SCA school construction work in connection with the resulting friable asbestos disturbance and exposure at P.S. 176.

We want to ensure that P.S. 176 is in compliance with AHERA (federal law); and provide us (parents) with the documents and information that we so desperately have been asking for and need in order to understand the severity of the asbestos disturbance and exposure at P.S. 176.  Furthermore, we ask that you take any other action deemed necessary to help our children and us (parents).

Respectfully,

Andres Juarez
Parent of Children Attending
P.S. 176 The Ovington School

To: <THPT@hpd.nyc.gov<mailto:THPT@hpd.nyc.gov>>


Dear THPT,

I hope this email finds you well.

I would like to file a complaint against my landlord who has been harassing me.

- The hot water has been turned off since 3/22/2025
- The electricity to my apartment has been turned off since 4/29/2025 around 5:30 am.
- He disconnected the radiators last year, although there are space heaters, they were not sufficient to heat the apartment due to the lack of insulation and often they would flip the breaker.  In those cases I would have to wait hours and sometimes days for them to flip the breaker back..
- There had been on-going construction without protection from dust and smell from getting into the apartment.
-He refused to replace the gas stove and we had a close call with gas poisoning.  He did remove the stove eventually with intervention from a 3rd party.
- He has made multiple buyout offers but calls them move-out incentives
- He dragged his feet on basic repairs as I have not had access to a functioning kitchen in months.
-He poured an unidentified red liquid into my apartment.  It evaporated within an hour, had a faint glue smell and made me sick.  I would often find a greasy substance on door handles/locks.  This scares me the most as I don't know what kind of poison I have come in contact with and what other substance I don't know about.   There is only a layer thin dry wall with the rest of the house with cracks though fixtures and pipes.  There are often strange smells coming from these areas as if poisonous gas is being piped through them .   I often get headaches and fevers.  I am the last one here, I am scared, and at my wits end.

I called the cops a number of times (a couple of times through transfer by 311)  but they were not happy, I would say even angry at me for involving them, and frankly do not view what he has done as crimes or assault.   A few of them flatly advised me to move.

I may need to move asap for my own safety but he should not be able to get away with this so freely.

Many thanks for your help,
Candice

This call (complaint) came in circa 2:45 PM �  I asked the parent to please submit a 311# so we have a record, stat, data.



I just called and spoke with the parent - these are kids from the local JHS / HS � and coming to the park right after school ends (circa 2:30 PM).



Hope this helps.



Thanks,

Hi Stanley,



Thanks for writing. Can you kindly provide more specific information as to the days of the week and times of day when mopeds have been observed at Seth Low Playground? As we have a very limited number of Parks Enforcement Patrol staff, specific information about when violations in parks occur is essential to accomplishing targeted enforcement and deploying our resources effectively.

Best regards,

Good afternoon,



I hope all is well. Please see my 311 complaint below regarding mopeds at Seth Low Park playground and ball courts. This seems to be a problem around this time of year; I really hope nobody gets hurt. These mopeds should not be in our playgrounds. Thank you for your urgent attention to this matter.

Good evening, there seems to be a big problem with the sit on scooters in Seth Low park playground. While riding bicycles around the perimeter of the park, my daughter was almost hit by one speeding into the park. It is mostly high school aged kids riding them around the running track and soccer fields even when they are crowded with young children playing. This is an every day occurrence and an accident waiting to happen. I contacted the police and they told me to call 311 which must be a joke. There needs to be either a permanent police presence in the park, or a complete ban on scooters in the park with consequences .Please let me know who I can contact if you can not do anything to help with this issue. Thank you

Dear Mr. Ng,

Nasi and I want you to know that Nasi went to the 61st precinct on monday April 28, 2025 to fill out a report against Mr. Warren for his abusive and harmful acts against Ibrokhim at 811K on February 25, 2025.

Yesterday we received the Report from Detective Jose Cofresi.The report is attached. Both Nasi and I were very shocked by the Report, which states that the ""investigation was completed"", which it was not, and that ""there was no abuse"" which is not true. We spoke with Mr. Cofresi last week, and he told us that no one from the school got back to him, and he was still barred from interviewing anyone at the school. So his report is false.

We need to hold Mr. Warren accountable for his actions, and we also need to provide the Superintendents of D75, and Brooklyn, what is happening.

Please advise us on what we should do now.

Thank you.

I just had a long conversation with Lieutenant Giambalve from the NYPD Detective Bureau.

Hi Betsy and Nasibakhon :

We received this email and our office is reviewing.

We wanted to make sure we are on the same page based on the information in this email. We see two problems:

1). We need to find a school for Ibrokhim Tadjitdinov.
2). We like to assist the police and get them involved if possible.

Now, before we go any further, I must bring up the FERPA laws to make sure this office doesn't violate the privacy rights of this minor.  If the parent(s) don't see any issue with this, I would like to propose a conference call among us on this email sometime this week if possible.

Let us know.

Dear Ms.Joyce,

Ibrokhim Tadjitdinov, 12 years old high functioning autistic student was suspended from his current school,  IS 281 Cavallaro and forced to attend 811K located at 2525 Haring Street<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.google.com/maps/search/2525*Haring*Street?entry=gmail&source=g__;Kys!!Pe07lN5AjA!QojgSGRyvMBS2ag9VsCxG3oWTrEIG2o3ca5tvjk4iYRp_kshTOqFjl62p3jm0OyUNBbFXDY_Tn7fzrI3d4jH0p40HKVoPg$> during suspension period.

On February 25, 2025 while he was at the 811k suspension site, Mr. Warren scratched Ibrokhim on the neck as he pulled Ibrokhim around the school by his shirt. Ibrokhim told us that Mr. Warren kicked him. Ibrokhim visited Maimonides hospital ER and report was sent over through the emergency room doctors.

Mr.Cofresi, precinct 61 detective, was assigned Ibrokhim Tadjitdinov's case.
Mr.Cofresi noted that he couldn't do anything as 811K school principal was not letting Mr.Cofresi speak with all involved in the case. It's almost 2 months and nothing is done. However, Assistant Principal emailed Nasibakhon to inform that case is closed. That email is attached to this email.

Ms.Kimberly Hassan assigned ACE reported me that she couldn't contact Mr.Cofresi. The phone number of report was sent is 718-283-2508.

Please help us to find out how this case was handled and what the outcome was. Ibrokhim can't go to 811K anymore if they suspend him again by any incident.

Thank you so much for your help in advance,

Hi Betsy and Nasibakhon :

We received this email and our office is reviewing.

We wanted to make sure we are on the same page based on the information in this email. We see two problems:

1). We need to find a school for Ibrokhim Tadjitdinov.
2). We like to assist the police and get them involved if possible.

Now, before we go any further, I must bring up the FERPA laws to make sure this office doesn't violate the privacy rights of this minor.  If the parent(s) don't see any issue with this, I would like to propose a conference call among us on this email sometime this week if possible.

Let us know.

Dear Ms.Joyce,

Ibrokhim Tadjitdinov, 12 years old high functioning autistic student was suspended from his current school,  IS 281 Cavallaro and forced to attend 811K located at 2525 Haring Street<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.google.com/maps/search/2525*Haring*Street?entry=gmail&source=g__;Kys!!Pe07lN5AjA!QojgSGRyvMBS2ag9VsCxG3oWTrEIG2o3ca5tvjk4iYRp_kshTOqFjl62p3jm0OyUNBbFXDY_Tn7fzrI3d4jH0p40HKVoPg$> during suspension period.

On February 25, 2025 while he was at the 811k suspension site, Mr. Warren scratched Ibrokhim on the neck as he pulled Ibrokhim around the school by his shirt. Ibrokhim told us that Mr. Warren kicked him. Ibrokhim visited Maimonides hospital ER and report was sent over through the emergency room doctors.

Mr.Cofresi, precinct 61 detective, was assigned Ibrokhim Tadjitdinov's case.
Mr.Cofresi noted that he couldn't do anything as 811K school principal was not letting Mr.Cofresi speak with all involved in the case. It's almost 2 months and nothing is done. However, Assistant Principal emailed Nasibakhon to inform that case is closed. That email is attached to this email.

Ms.Kimberly Hassan assigned ACE reported me that she couldn't contact Mr.Cofresi. The phone number of report was sent is 718-283-2508.

Please help us to find out how this case was handled and what the outcome was. Ibrokhim can't go to 811K anymore if they suspend him again by any incident.

Thank you so much for your help in advance,

***MEDIA ADVISORY***



As City Faces Elevated Wildfire Risk, New York City Council Expected to Vote to Require Strategic Planning to Prevent and Mitigate Wildfires in City Parks



Council also expected to vote on legislation to preserve cap on fees restaurants are charged by delivery apps



The New York City Council is expected to vote on the following items at Thursday's Stated Meeting. All items on the Council�s agenda are subject to change. The full agenda will be available here following committee votes.



Legislation:



Requiring a Strategic Plan to Mitigate Wildfires in City Parks

New York City�s parks, greenways, and natural areas are increasingly vulnerable to brush fires, especially during extended dry spells. With over 30,000 areas of parkland, representing 14% of the City�s total land areas, the risk to these green spaces is significant. In just the first two weeks of November 2024, the FDNY responded to a record-breaking 271 fires<https://www.nyc.gov/site/fdny/news/Y11-13/fdny-releases-new-psa-during-historic-period-brush-fires-across-new-york-city#:~:text=During%20the%20time%20period%20of,in%20New%20York%20City%20history> across the city, the highest number ever recorded in such a short timeframe.



Introduction 1185-A<https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7102686&GUID=E7F5D0BF-BA36-4677-863C-2A59D4581974&Options=ID|Text|&Search=int.+1185>, sponsored by Council Member Shekar Krishnan, would require the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) to develop a strategic plan to mitigate the occurrences of wildfires in New York City�s parks by March 1, 2026. The plan would have to be posted on DPR�s website and updated regularly. This bill would also require DPR to report annually on wildfires that occur in parks under its jurisdiction.



Preserving Limits on Fees Delivery Apps Can Charge Restaurants

The COVID-19 pandemic drove rapid growth in food delivery services. But high fees charged by food delivery apps place significant financial strain on restaurants, especially for small businesses. In response, the Council enacted legislation capping the fees that delivery platforms can charge. While this law provided critical relief, New York City is one of the last of the more than 100 cities that enacted the policy to keep it after the pandemic in the wake of lawsuits by delivery app companies. These legal challenges threatened the viability of the protections for restaurants. The following legislation preserves the existing fee caps, while allowing delivery apps to offer additional optional services for additional, limited fees. It allows restaurants to avoid mandatory, exorbitant fees and instead opt into enhanced services, such as marketing efforts by the apps on behalf of the restaurant, in exchange for a higher fee. The bill also establishes strong protections for those who do not opt in, by clearly defining the basic services that must remain subject to capped rates.



Introduction 762-B<https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6632578&GUID=874ADD05-D520-4896-BA03-79A18349EADD&Options=ID|Text|&Search=762>, sponsored by Council Member Rafael Salamanca, Jr., would maintain limits on the fees that third-party delivery services can charge restaurants, while allowing apps to provide optional enhanced services for an additional fee of 20 percent. It would only permit charging an enhanced service fee, however, if the delivery service also offers the option to purchase a basic service plan at a cost no higher than the current fee limits that includes delivery services and being listed and discoverable on the third-party platform.



Tracking Student Access to School Libraries and Librarians

Introduction 1125-A<https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7029046&GUID=C004ADBB-8D76-4AB7-837C-86896FA4E18C&Options=ID|Text|&Search=int.+1125>, sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler, would require the Department of Education to report annually the number of licensed and non-licensed school librarians at each school, the number of school libraries, and other data related to student access to library staff and facilities, including compliance with state staffing requirements.



Annually Auditing Contract Awards to Minority and Women Business Enteprises

Introduction 23-A,<https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6505382&GUID=A9D5DD2A-1D82-4AEC-A03F-156EE1952881&Options=ID|Text|&Search=int.+23> sponsored by Majority Whip Selvena Brooks-Powers, would require the City Comptroller to publish an annual report that indicates the total share of City procurement contracts that were awarded to minority- and women-owned business enterprises (MWBE�s) for the most recent fiscal year. The report would include information regarding the contract value, awarding agency, and demographics of the MWBEs.



Requiring Taxis and For-Hire Vehicles to Display Signs for Passengers to Look Out for Cyclists

Introduction 193-A<https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6557538&GUID=FEBD037C-7B97-4641-8C11-496654004F71&Options=ID|Text|&Search=int.+193>, sponsored by Council Member Jennifer Guti�rrez, would require all taxis and for-hire vehicles to prominently display a sign on all rear passenger doors warning passengers to look for cyclists before opening the door. The signs would be provided to drivers and vehicle owners at no cost by the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC).



Designating May 10 as Chinese American Railroad Worker Memorial Day

Resolution 844<https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7287072&GUID=28D92BDD-2B1D-4BF9-8867-68E44F3FBE4A&Options=&Search=>, sponsored by Council Member Susan Zhuang, would recognize May 10th annually as Chinese American Railroad Workers Memorial Day in New York City. Nearly 12,000 Chinese immigrants were employed by the Central Pacific Railroad Company to build a transcontinental railroad. Nearly 1,200 Chinese railroad workers died from accidents, avalanches, and explosions during this work.



Recognizing Life, Legacy and Achievements of Judith Jamison

Resolution 741<https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7137388&GUID=D05EC957-19EB-43C6-A047-A47520E406B5&Options=&Search=>, sponsored by Council Member Carlina Rivera, would designate May 10th annually as Judith Jamison Day in the City of New York to honor her life and legacy as a dancer, choreographer, and longtime artistic director of the groundbreaking Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.



Supporting the Equity in Fertility Treatment Act

Resolution 165-B<https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6557809&GUID=DF947885-DEA2-44A7-8D5B-8EFDFE15594D&Options=ID|Text|&Search=165>, sponsored by Council Member Mercedes Narcisse, would call on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.5545/A.885, the Equity in Fertility Treatment Act.



Calling for State Legislation to Cap the Cost of Routine Medical Procedures

Resolution 822-A<https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7281636&GUID=7CBBF20D-2C9B-48CF-BD52-7A7DABF7F745&Options=ID|Text|&Search=822>, sponsored by Council Member Lynn Schulman, would call on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.705/A.2140, which would cap the amount people pay for non-complicated, routine medical procedures at 150% of the cost paid by Medicare for those same services.



Land Use:

102-51 Queens Boulevard Rezoning � a private application to facilitate a new 17-story, mixed-use building with approximately 216 residential units, 54 of which will be permanently affordable under Mandatory Inclusionary Housing (MIH), in Council Member Lynn Schulman�s district.

Hi Xavier, I went on the website � who will have access to my phone number? I plan to use my work phone number rather than my cell phone � however, I am not in the office all the time, and there is some language about verifying my identity?  I do not want my cell phone number to be publicly shared as part of my written testimony.  Sorry for all the questions. Thanks and best, Vivian

Hi Vivian,



Written testimony can be submitted up to three days after the hearing.  Guidelines, including where to submit, can be found here: https://council.nyc.gov/testify/<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/council.nyc.gov/testify/__;!!LAh5qUgpm5Y!FMjBOQ0rIZpSubFO4lTDIgnRPVQazxa6qZ6DW4bvcQaZlmxUJxsodH2WS2U0PxBMtcvaWJ1C1muLLwTcGAwxqJpJn_d8pfXSnw$> In person testimony does not require pre-registration as you can just register with the sergeant at arms once in City Hall.  However, there is an oversight hearing the day this resolution will be heard, so I anticipate that the public hearing for the resolution will be after 10:30 AM, so it will probably be easier for you to submit written testimony.  Let me know if you have any other questions.

Whereas, The nearly 2,000-mile Transcontinental Railroad, which shortened travel time across the United States (U.S) from six months to one week, was completed on May 10, 1869, when the Central Pacific Railroad Company and the Union Pacific Railroad Company linked railroad tracks with a golden spike at Promontory Summit, Utah; and

Whereas, One of the earliest proponents for the construction of a transcontinental railroad was New York City (NYC) entrepreneur Asa Whitney, who in 1845 presented a proposal to the U.S. Congress for a railroad running from Lake Michigan to the Pacific; and

Whereas, While Whitney�s initial proposal failed, it set in motion the idea of a transcontinental railroad that would be championed in the 1860s by engineer Theodore Judah, who lobbied to pass the Pacific Railroad Act in the U.S. House of Representatives on May 6, 1862, and in the U.S. Senate on June 6, 1862; and

Whereas, On July 1, 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed into law the Pacific Railroad Act of 1862, which authorized the Central Pacific Railroad Company, co-founded by Charles Crocker, a Troy, New York native, and the Union Pacific Railroad Company, controlled by Wall Street investor Thomas Durant, to build a transcontinental railroad that would link the U.S. from east to west; and

Whereas, Work began in 1863, as the Central Pacific Railroad Company started to build its tracks in Sacramento moving east and the Union Pacific Railroad Company started to build westward from Council Bluffs, Iowa, where railroad lines were already operating from the eastern part of the country; and

Whereas, For six years, the workers of both companies toiled to lay down the rail beds, tracks, and other necessary infrastructure; and

Whereas, The workers of the Central Pacific Railroad Company initially numbered many Irish immigrants from NYC and Boston; and

Whereas, Because of difficulties in recruiting a sufficient number of workers, nearly 12,000 Chinese immigrants were employed by the Central Pacific Railroad Company and made up more than 80 percent of its workforce; and

Whereas, According to 2019 U.S. House of Representatives Resolution ( H. Res.) 165, the Chinese workers �were given the most difficult, dangerous jobs and were paid lower wages than other railroad workers� and �nearly 1,200 Chinese railroad workers died from work accidents, avalanches, and explosions while working in the Sierra Nevada Mountains�; and

Whereas, According to H. Res. 165, the Chinese workers, who once set a world record when they laid 10 miles of track in one day, were thought of as �indispensable by their foremen and were respected for their work ethic and discipline�; and

Whereas, In 2014, the U.S. Department of Labor inducted the Chinese railroad workers into the Labor Hall of Honor, noting that they �faced prejudice, low wages and social isolation,� but, in spite of these challenges, � they courageously took a stand to organize for fairer wages and safer working conditions�; and

Whereas, According to H. Res. 165, the Chinese workers� fight against unfair labor practices �set an example for the millions of Asian Americans who came to the [U.S] after them�; and

Whereas, According to H. Res. 165, �both the descendants of these workers and the wider Asian-American community view the sacrifices of the Chinese railroad workers as being integral to the creation of the vibrant and growing Asian-American community� in the U.S. today; and

Whereas, According to 2020 population figures provided by the Asian American Federation, over 600,000 Chinese and Chinese Americans live in NYC, with roughly one-third being U.S. born, one-third being naturalized citizens, and one-third being non-citizens; and

Whereas, According to those figures, roughly 40 percent of Chinese and Chinese Americans reside in Queens, with another approximately 35 percent residing in Brooklyn; and

Whereas, The considerable cultural, economic, and political contributions of New Yorkers of Chinese descent help make NYC what it is today; and

Whereas, It is fitting that the early contributions of the Chinese railroad workers also be honored and celebrated by all New Yorkers; now, therefore, be it

Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York recognizes May 10 annually as Chinese American Railroad Workers Memorial Day in New York City.

Good day Stanley,

Attached form needs to be filled out completely and returned with a photo of the location the sign is to be installed on.  Please note that there needs to be an existing street name sign as the co-namings must go under.

Note this isn't scheduled until I receive the above items and my team confirms it in an email.

Yes, it will take a minimum of 3 weeks for the actual dedication.

Has the location been approved by the City Council and the Mayor? If so, then I will put you in contact with the division from DOT who handles co-naming.

Good day Stanley,

Attached form needs to be filled out completely and returned with a photo of the location the sign is to be installed on.  Please note that there needs to be an existing street name sign as the co-namings must go under.

Note this isn't scheduled until I receive the above items and my team confirms it in an email.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you,

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Seth Low Park

Good evening, there seems to be a big problem with the sit on scooters in Seth Low park playground. While riding bicycles around the perimeter of the park, my daughter was almost hit by one speeding into the park. It is mostly high school aged kids riding them around the running track and soccer fields even when they are crowded with young children playing. This is an every day occurrence and an accident waiting to happen. I contacted the police and they told me to call 311 which must be a joke. There needs to be either a permanent police presence in the park, or a complete ban on scooters in the park with consequences .Please let me know who I can contact if you can not do anything to help with this issue. Thank you

Our office been in contact with the Park department Enforcement people � and one of the issue that came up � is the date time that these riders are in the park.  The 311# is a tool that they use to accentuate the best time for the squad to catch the riders.

https://www.nycgovparks.org/about/urban-park-service/park-enforcement-patrol

I�m going to forward your email to that group � For the future, I would ask (encourage) you to please submit the NYC 311# (with date/time)  - and forward those 311 numbers to us immediately.  We will follow up.

Good day Stanley,

Attached form needs to be filled out completely and returned with a photo of the location the sign is to be installed on.  Please note that there needs to be an existing street name sign as the co-namings must go under.

Note this isn't scheduled until I receive the above items and my team confirms it in an email.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you,

Yes, it will take a minimum of 3 weeks for the actual dedication.

Has the location been approved by the City Council and the Mayor? If so, then I will put you in contact with the division from DOT who handles co-naming.

The show will last approximately 45 minutes. I have attached a flyer about the show for more information.

If she is able to come for the entire show, or just for the beginning, please arrive 5 to 10 minutes before to allow us time to prepare for your visit. Someone from our staff will be there as well; we will put you in touch with them closer to the performance date.
